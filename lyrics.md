## In December
# 1. When it rains, it pours

when it rains, it pours
and overflows all around your door
to pool and saturate the ground
is this how you live now?
to make your bed 
by the bend
of the river
 
when it rains, it pours 

on muddy roads where no more cars can go

well, they’ll spin out and get stuck out in the yard

a sedan gutted for its parts

to make a home for milkweed

or yarrow 

in summer



> when it rains, it pours
> and white noises drown out all our words
> well, it’s the sound of every sound at once
> on a pallet you wonder, how did all of this start?
> and who’ll make note of it
> when it’s over?

when it rains, it pours

the earth didn’t need the word
(the earth did not need word)
no, form did not come first
(no, form did not come first)
to see some beauty cannot save us
but i guess it couldn’t hurt

(the earth does not need word)
